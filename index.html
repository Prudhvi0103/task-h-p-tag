<pre> This system maintains the employee details in DB2 table and updates the details when
required thus avoiding inconsistent details. It facilitates the searching of employee details in an efficient
way. The INSERT module inserts the new employee details of the organization and the DELETE module
deletes the particular employee details which already existed. The UPDATE module updates the details
of employee when some changes occur and the ENQUIRY module gets the details of a particular
employee of that organization </pre>
